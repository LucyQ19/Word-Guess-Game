# Word-Guess-Game

### How My Game Works:

* It is a word guessing game where the player selects any key on the keyboard to start playing.
* The player guesses letters to determine the word, based on the length of underscores displayed on the screen.
* If the player guesses letter correctly, the letter goes in one of the underscores.
* If the player does not guess correctly, the letter goes to Letters Already Guessed, and the Number of Guesses Remaining decreases by one.
* If the player guesses the word correctly, the wins increases by one point.  The screen displays a animated gif of the correct word, and the theme song plays.
* If the player does not guess the word correctly, the losses increases by one point.  The screen displays a animated gif indicating you did not get the word correct, and no theme music plays.
